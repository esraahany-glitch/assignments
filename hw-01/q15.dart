/* What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language,
 and how does it
impact the way variables are used?*/


/*Dart is a statically-typed language, which means that variable types are determined at compile time.
This affects the way variables are used because once a variable is declared with a specific type,
 it cannot change to another type,
 and type errors are detected early before the program runs. */
